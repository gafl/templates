Karma Jasmine Project Template
==============================

Simple template starting point for a JavaScript project using [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html) test runner and [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) test framework.

Getting Started
---------------

# Install Node.js

Ensure you have Node.js 6.x or later and NPM installed. See Karma [installation](http://karma-runner.github.io/latest/intro/installation.html) for latest version requirements.

# Install Karma and plugins

```
# In the project directory
$ npm install
```

# Run Karma

```
$ ./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start
```

You might find it useful to install `karma-cli` globally (required for Windows).

```
$ npm install -g karma-cli
```

Then you can run Karma by `karma` from anywhere.

# Edit specs and code

Bootstrap Jasmine spec and JS files are provided in the `src` folder.
